Blah Blah **README COMING SOON YA'LL**

## Install

	npm install fideo

## Usage

fideo is meant to be consumed in a [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) environment (though you can also use a pre-bundled version, more below):
	
	var fideo = require('fideo')

## Bundled Version

If you don't want to mess with a build process you can also include the pre-bundled version found in `dist/fideo.bundled.js` in your project which exposes `fideo()` globally.

## Todo
